# tokenizer

Welcome to the blockchain, welcome to the future (or not) !

The aim of this project is to create and deploy a token on a blockchain. For that we have to choose a blockchain allowing users to create their own tocken on it. A lot of blockchains allow us to do that, like Etherum, Solana, BSC, ... We chose the BNB Smart Chain, a.k.a BSC, for the deployement of our token, for its accessibility, the low gas fees, its EVM compatibility and the diversity of applications built on.

We chose to respect the ERC20 token standart for our token, which is the most common way to build a new token, allowing the deployment of the token on multiple blockchain without modifiying the code.
